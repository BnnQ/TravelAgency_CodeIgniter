# Description

TravelAgency is a prototype web application designed to provide a comprehensive solution for travel agencies to manage their services. It allows for the addition, update, and removal of travel packages, keeping track of bookings, and managing customer information.

The application is built with CodeIgniter 4, a powerful PHP framework known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. CodeIgniter 4 provides a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. The database is managed using MySQL, a reliable and widely used relational database management system.

While the design of the site is simple, leveraging Bootstrap for responsiveness and ease of use, its main advantage lies in its comfortable and easily scalable admin dashboard. This makes TravelAgency a robust and efficient tool for travel agencies, despite its prototype status.

Whether you're a startup travel agency looking for a management solution, or a developer seeking a scalable admin dashboard, TravelAgency serves as a great starting point.
